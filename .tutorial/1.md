# 3.4 - Tables and Interaction

#### This is a multi-day lesson. We will add to it as we go.

Any time you want to make a game or application, you need to know what it will look like before you code the logic. It feels backwards but step 1 to any project (after creating the requirements) is to create the user interface first.


### Recall:
- HTML documents have a basic structure that needs to be used
- _Elements_ on a page are created by using _`<tags>`_ in the HTML file
- Most `<tags>` require a closing `</tag>`
- Tags can have _options_ like `href=`, `width=`, `src=`, and so on.
- Memorizing tags is helpful but _not necessary_. [Just look them up](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/)!

### Warm-up:
Inside the [images](#images) folder are a couple images. One is an ❌, one an ◯, and one is just a blank placeholder. 
1. Select an image to place on the page. [Place the image on the page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) with a width of 100 pixels.
2. Use [the anchor tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp) to make the image a _hyperlink_. The link should go to "w3schools.com/html". See if you can get the link to open in a new tab.
